![Me](/me.png 'Enrico Pesce')

Born in the Venice (Italy) area. Passionate about electronics, video games, and hacking with open-source software, my work experience started in the 00s with big and startup companies, from local data centers to cloud computing solutions focusing on the internet services and e-commerce markets. 

Today I live in Malaga as an engineer of pre-sales cloud solutions at Oracle Inc and I tell my daily working life in this blog.
