## Introduction to the most modern cloud database in the market

Oracle Autonomous Database is a cloud database that uses machine learning techniques to automate its tuning, security, backup, updates, and other management procedures traditionally carried out by a DBA. Unlike a conventional database, Autonomous performs all these and other activities without the need for human intervention.

#### Why use Autonomous?

Databases contain critical business data and are essential for the efficient operation of modern organizations. DBAs are often busy with repetitive and manual database management and maintenance activities. As administration activities increase, the risk of human error becomes higher with catastrophic consequences.

Business applications continue to add new records to existing databases over the years and use database information to create reports, analyze trends, or detect anomalies. This can cause databases to grow to many terabytes in size and become extremely complex, making them even more challenging to manage, protect, and optimize for peak performance. At the same time, data attack vectors are increasing, and missing security updates expose data to significant risks.

This amplifies the need for efficient and secure database management that enhances data security, reduces downtime, improves performance by increasing exposure to human error. An Autonomous Database can address all these issues.

#### Benefits of Autonomous

There are several advantages over traditional solutions:

- High uptime, maximum database performance and security, including automatic updates and fixes
- Elimination of error-prone manual management activities through automation
- Cost reduction and productivity improvement by automating manual routine activities
- Using Autonomous allows an organization to allocate database management staff to higher-level activities, creating greater business value.

#### Key features of Autonomous

##### Automatic Provisioning

Automatically create mission-critical databases that are fault-tolerant and highly reliable. The solution allows for perfect horizontal scalability, protection in case of hardware failure, and enables database updates without blocking the applications that use it.

##### Automatic Configuration

The database automatically optimizes its configuration based on the specific workload. From memory configuration to data formats and access structures, it is optimized to enhance performance. Customers can simply load the data and get started.

##### Auto-Indexing

Automatically identifies missing indexes that could speed up applications. Validates each index to ensure its benefits before implementing it and uses machine learning techniques to learn from its mistakes.

##### Automatic Scaling

The database automatically scales computing resources up or down as needed for the workload. Scaling occurs online during execution without blocking applications that use the database.

##### Automated Data Protection

Automatically protects sensitive and regulated data in the database, all through a unified management console. Evaluates the security of configuration, users, sensitive data, and unusual database activities.

##### Automated Security

Automatically applies encryption for the entire database, backups, and all network connections. No access to the operating system or administrator privileges, preventing phishing attacks. Protects the system from cloud operations and potential malicious internal users.

##### Automatic Backups

Automatic daily backup of the database. Restore the database at any specified time of the day within the last 60 days.

##### Automatic Patching

Automatic patching and updates without downtime. Applications continue to run while patch installation occurs in a round-robin fashion among the nodes or servers in the cluster without blocking applications that use the database.

##### Automated Detection and Resolution

Using pattern recognition, hardware failures are automatically predicted without long timeouts. IOs are immediately redirected to functioning devices to avoid database blocks. Continuous monitoring for each database automatically generates service requests for any unforeseen events.

##### Automatic Failover

Automatic failover with no data loss. It is completely transparent to end-user applications. Provides 99.995% SLA.
